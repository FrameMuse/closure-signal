# Signal
Very small, basically Fundamental Signal Implementation compliant with [tc39 Signals proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals).

Adaptation from [Andrea Giammarchi's code](https://github.com/WebReflection/signal) and [Ryan Carniato's Signal Article](https://dev.to/ryansolid/building-a-reactive-library-from-scratch-1i0p).
